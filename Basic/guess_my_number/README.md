# 🎲 Number Guessing Game 🎮

A simple **Python-based** number guessing game where the user has to guess a **random number** between **1 and 10**.

## 📌 How It Works?
1. The game **generates a random number** between 1 and 10.
2. The player is asked to **enter their name** before starting.
3. The player **guesses the number** until they get it right.
4. The program gives feedback:
   - ✅ **Correct guess:** "Congratulations! You guessed the number!"
   - ❌ **Incorrect guess:** "Wrong guess, try again!"
5. If the user enters an **invalid input** (non-numeric), the program asks them to enter a valid number.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- `random` module (to generate a random number)
