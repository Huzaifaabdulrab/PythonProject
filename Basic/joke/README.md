# ðŸ˜‚ Random Joke Generator

A simple **Python script** that tells **random jokes** every time you run it.  
You can keep asking for **more jokes** or **quit** whenever you like.

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works?
1. The script starts by **telling a random joke** from a predefined list.
2. You will get two options:
   - **Press 1** to hear another joke.
   - **Press 2** to quit.
3. If you press **1**, youâ€™ll get another **random joke**.
4. If you press **2**, the program will **exit gracefully**.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- `random` module (to select a random joke)
