# ðŸš€ Countdown to Liftoff!

A simple **Python script** that **counts down from 10 to 1** and then prints **"Liftoff!"** after a 1-second delay between each number.

## ðŸ“Œ How it Works?
1. The script starts a **countdown from 10**.
2. It **pauses for 1 second** after printing each number.
3. Once the countdown reaches **1**, it prints **"Liftoff!"** ðŸš€

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python
- `time` Module (for the countdown delay)
